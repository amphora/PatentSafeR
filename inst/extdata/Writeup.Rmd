# Introduction

This is an example of an R Markdown file using R and Markdown. 
Below, we'll create a simple data frame and perform a basic plot using ggplot2.

# Create Data Frame

Here's a simple data frame with two variables, `x` and `y`, containing random 
values.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(50),
  y = rnorm(50)
)
head(data)
```

# Plot Data using ggplot2

Now, let's create a scatterplot of the data using ggplot2:

```{r plot}
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of x and y", x = "X-axis", y = "Y-axis")
```

# Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to create a simple R Markdown document 
that includes data manipulation and plotting with R. R Markdown is a 
powerful tool for combining code, comments, and results into a single, 
easy-to-read document.
